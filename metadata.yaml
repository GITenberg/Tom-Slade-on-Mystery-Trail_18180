description: At Temple Camp you may hear the story told of how Llewellyn, scout of
  the first class, and Orestes, winner of the merit badges for architecture and for
  music, were by their scouting skill and lore instrumental in solving a mystery and
  performing a great good turn. Yet if you should ask old Uncle Jeb Rushmore, beloved
  manager of the big scout camp, about these two scout heroes, a shrewd twinkle would
  appear in his eye and he would refer you to the boys, who would probably only laugh
  at you, for they are a bantering set at Temple Camp and would jolly the life out
  of Daniel Boone himself if that redoubtable woodsman were there. Listen then while
  I tell you of how Tom Slade, friend and brother of these two scouts, as he is of
  all scouts, assisted them, and of how they assisted him; and of how, out of these
  reciprocal good turns, there came true peace and happiness, which is the aim and
  end of all scouting.
